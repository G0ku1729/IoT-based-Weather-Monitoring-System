# IoT-based-Weather-Monitoring-System
The project introduces an IoT-based Weather Monitoring System using Raspberry Pi, which provides real-time weather data.

# Key Features
• The primary objective is to address the need for up-to-date weather information to facilitate preparation and decision-making based on current weather conditions.
• The system incorporates DHT11 and BMP180 sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, which are crucial environmental parameters for weather assessment.
• The project utilizes ThingSpeak, an IoT platform, to collect, analyze, and visualize weather data, making it accessible over the internet.
• A user-friendly RaspController app is employed for remote management and monitoring of the Raspberry Pi.
• Applications of the system include digital temperature monitoring in laboratories, greenhouse temperature control, and environment monitoring in warehouses and factories.
